i am comparing each word of input with each word of product name and store the product id ,no of words compared and no of words matched.
now the array in which the pid is stored is traversed and checking whether and pid are repeated,if so then no of words compared and no of words matched
are sum up with the repeated pid and the repeated id is deleted. Now the array  is sorted in decending based on no of words matched. Now we are checking 
whether no of words compared is equal to no of words matched if so then the pid is moved upword;
